This set claims you can race other cars, etc, but you only get one with this set.  Plus, it\\'s not like you can make a bigger or different set with this one.  It\\'s pretty limited in how you design or create a track.  If it came with two cars, you could \"race\" them etc, but alone, it\\'s pretty dry stuff.\\nMy nephews like to tear stuff up and re-design their own tracks but this is what it is - a single track.

The character Diaz plays so well is dishonest, greedy, lazy, irresponsible, rude, utterly self-serving and in every way despicable. She is educating your kids, folks, and her manipulative, blackmailing ways win out for her in the end. This is funny, OK?\\n\\nThe film gets two stars rather than one because, on a purely technical level, it works as a (very improbable) narrative. The storyline is coherent and the editing snappy, the actors give their all, the script does have its moments, it's watchable. But somehow it's hard to get past the overall message the film leaves you with: if you're a selfish, lying, morally bankrupt, pot-smoking, drunken, money-grubbing whore willing to blackmail and deceive all around you whilst having complete contempt for any kind of professional responsibility to your students and their futures, this is in some way admirable. You will win out over more honest and responsible people, and it's hilarious.\\n\\nNo, it's not.\",\n",

The ending definitely sets things up for a continuation and that means more of my favorite fictional couple!\\n\\nLocked and Loaded picks up exactly where Armed & Dangerous left off; right in the middle of Michael and Christina\\'s first fully consensual moment of intimacy. It\\'s nice to see the development in their relationship. Christina is still growing into her sexuality and sorting out her feelings for Michael. Michael is feeling somewhat vulnerable having confessed his love and now believing that Christina \"has him right where she wants him\" which makes him somewhat defensive. Or as Christina describes him \"Michael was like a half-tamed dog, as likely to turn on you as he was to snuggle up against you and lick your face, and just as slow to trust\". Their relationship isn\\'t easy, but it is realistic and the characterization as usual is spot on. It is gratifying to see the emotion and trust grow between them; and Michael\\'s sharing of his sexual fetish says as much about their individual growth as it is simply. rather titillating. The story is equally divided between relationship building and plot, suspense and intrigue. Christina finds that her plan of joining the BN to be trained as a hacker doesn\\'t work out exactly as she had anticipated; and Michael still has the IMA and the psychotically evil Callaghan to contend with. The story ends on a Happily for now note. My only complaint is that it was too short. I want more excitement, more intrigue, more wonderfully enjoyable dialogue and more realistically portrayed emotional growth from my 2 all time favorite characters.

All three actresses were quite good and this was a nice afternoon escape film.

       " '\"First Blood\" has to be, without a doubt, one of my favorite action films of all time. I believe that I enjoy it so much because it does a nice job of balancing action scenes with drama. Thus, this film does not reek of the overkill violence that plagues the two sequels (as well as the films of other action stars). Stallone actually does some acting in this film. His performance as a Vietnam Vet come home to find a thankless country is compelling and his emotional breakdown near the end of the film is fantastic. There is a lot of suspense in this film and the characters are certainly memorable. Rambo has a clear enemy in this film, played by Brian Dennehy. He is not taking on the country of Vietnam or the Russians-he is simply defending himself from a small-town cop. My recommendation is to see this film and forget about the two sequels. Of course, any die-hard Rambo fan will tell you that the action sequences only become better as the movies progressed, but they sacrifice much to do this in my opinion.

       " \"I'm going to review this movie for 1 reason only, and it's for the HDR (4k release) content. My opinion on the movie itself is too subjective, and some people just hate Zach Snyder so they won't watch this movie anyways. Anyhow, let's talk about the HDR, and you're buying this for the upgraded visuals. Let me tell you something, the last half of the movie is SIMPLY STUNNING and if you have a newer 4k television with the ability to handle HDR correctly, you'll be in for a visual treat. This is the movie you show to people that have not seen 4k and HDR before, because the colors and contrast pops so much it's stunning. You're literally going to be amazed how bright some objects in the scenes look. Zach Snyder is known for loving his darker scenes, and this movie is very dark in tone and in plot, but then he amazes us with a visual treat when the action  picks up and that dark mood is met with explosions, bright glowing kryptonite, and heat vision eye blasts. If there was a way to capture the image to prove this to you, I would do so and upload it. For now, you need the right type of UHD HDTV that is calibrated and can handle HDR content, and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. The movies for 4k with HDR are lacking right now, and you want to show off? Pick up this title, because even if you aren't a fan of the plot, you WILL be a fan of showing this off to others.\",\n",

Basically, the plot has Beckinsale (with a boyish short hair cut) playing an art student in Barcelona, who finds that a flemish painting holds clues to some murder, or something. The whole thing is very dull, full with ridiculous situations and characters.

       " \"I'm going to start this review with an honest confession: if I needed a wet/dry vac on a regular basis, I would probably rate this product much lower. But, I don't need one very often - consequently, this style is ideal and rates a four star as related to my needs.\\n\\n1) It doesn't take up a lot of space. Because it just snaps onto the top of a bucket, there is no need to store a full apparatus. This simply stays in a plastic tub with several other resources, ready to be pulled out.\\n2) The needed bucket is a very commonplace one. You're not going to get this and be annoyed because you don't have just the right bucket - unless, of course, the bucket you own is a rather odd one in the first place.\\n3) It's very easy to use, Just snap the motor onto the bucket, put the hose in place, and you're ready to go.\\n4) The suction is good. Strong enough to suck a wet spot dry.\\n\\nSo, are there negatives? Yes, even for my usage, there are a few negatives to this product.\\n1) The power cord is short. Either pull out an extension cord, or deal with limited access. The hose is also short, but that's only relevant if you have issues getting the bucket close enough to the mess needing to be cleaned up.\\n2) The hose needs to be attached before the motor is connected to the bucket. Not because that's order of operations, but because the two openings are not labeled.\\n3) They dry vac bag is rather small. Since this is considered useful for sucking debris that's a little too large for a normal vacuum, the collection bag could be a bit bigger.\\n\\nI can think of several past household situations - leaks, washer issues, plumbing problems, etc. - when this would have been a handy tool. Not enough to need a full-fledged wet vac, but enough that something like this would have been worth having around.\",\n",

The imagery was clear, striking and gripping.  While there was little complex plot to speak of - it didn't need one.  In a world such as that, life becomes simple and difficult, that's how the story was presented.\\n\\nI question some of the decisions by the father, but he's not meant to be infallible, just human.  His identity and former life are meaningless in such a world, and he is left anonymous, which I truly appreciate.  I can also appreciate the risk the boy took at the end - how difficult would it be to carry on alone?\\n\\nI can't yet give the book five stars, and wavered between three and four, but it's entirely possible that as the years go by and I pick this one up again, I may appreciate it more.  Given the time it takes to read, it's worthwhile for just about anyone.\",\n",
       " 'My only recollection of the TV version of \"The Green Hornet\" is when they did a guest appearance on \"Batman\".  Robin(Burt Ward) fought Kato(Bruce Lee) to a draw(?!).  Kipnapped heiress Pinky Pinkston left an SOS for the Dynamic Duo in her alphabet soup.  The guest villain was the incomparable Roger C. Carmel as Colonel Gumm.  What does all this have to do with the price of tea in China?  Absolutely nothing but I figured I\\'d write some totally superfluous and extraneous remarks for the Hornet haters who\\'ll get all over me for loving this movie.  I never read the comic books or saw the Tv series so I accept this movie for what it is and it\\'s a total blast.  Star/writer/producer Seth Rogen took a character that is sacrosanct to many and fashioned it to fit his devil-may-care persona purists be damned.  The nocturnal adventures of the Hornet and Kato come off more as a fraternity pledge prank than as some altruistic endeavor and I thought that was a hoot.  What would Kevin Smith think?  Rogen is aces in my book but the real find is Jay Chou as Kato. Chou\\'s Kato has a real alliance with the Hornet instead of just riding shotgun and displaying his karate moves.  Christoph Waltz extends his street cred that he established in \"Inglourious Basterds\" as the head of the Russian mob and he\\'s as equally chilling and funny as he was in that movie.  James Franco has a terrific cameo as Waltz\\'s \"competition\".  And how can you forget the cool cars and stunt work.  I love that Rogen took the material not too seriously but just serious enough.',\n",
       " \"Judging by the Cover. By Dawn Doyle  4 Stars\\nThe say blood is thicker than water, and family comes before anything. I found out real quick that blood is not thicker than Money. Everything I thought I knew had turned upside down in the blink of an eye. Demi who escapes after witnessing several family members being murdered. She is placed into protective custody  and moved across country. Demi has to keep herself hidden, not recognisable while out and about. So she dresses in goth clothes and dyes her hair. Jordan the guy that lives next door is furious that someone has moved into his best friends house. Demi and Jordan's first meeting did not go well at all. He knows he is being irrational about this but he is too hurt to care about anything but  his own feelings. Even with time they still cannot stand each other. But Jordan senses that there's something different about the goth looking girl. As their friendship develops secrets come to light and they understand each other better. They must prepare to protect themselves to survive. This was a very exciting book with lots of sitting on the edge of your seat biting your nail moments. The banter between Demi and Jordan was hilarious as much as heart warming. Can these two find love before the bad guys find Demi. The author did a great job with the story and  keeps you guessing throughout the book.\",\n",

       " 'This is a long 2 part story. It appears to be made for Canadian TV. No sex, nudity, or bad language. Like American movies, the bad guys are black, except in this one they speak French Canadian. The main bad guys hang out in Switzerland and boast a mish-mash of indistinguishable international accents, including one female (Belladonna Lithia) whose haircut makes me think she was once part of the Swedish Bikini team of the 1980\\'s.\\n\\nRyan Carnes plays Chris Mooore, who lives with people he thinks are his parents. Like Luke Skywalker his past is kept secret and then one day he comes home, finds his legal guardians killed by the bad guys and vows revenge. Like Spiderman, he also likes the redhead next door. And there is a corporate meeting which reminded me of the one in Kill Bill.\\n\\nChris Moore has lost his memory and doesn\\'t know he is the Phantom, although he does like to jump around the roofs of buildings. Once he is arrested, his DNA goes out on the Interpol network and he is discovered by the Good Guys and the Bad Guys, the Singh. Eventually Chris assumes the role of the Phantom and uses his new high tech bullet proof suit. It turns out his dad died from cancer (must have been those purple dyed asbestos fibers in the old suit). The bad guys have  a weapon called \"Flicker\" or Flickr for you Yahoos or Flicka for you cowboys. This device uses digital TV to turn people into Manchurian Candidates, who will keep the war machine going and the arms dealers rich.\\n\\nThe movie doesn\\'t have long drawn out action scenes. It is long on dialogue and building characters. If this is the first in a series. i.e. an introduction of characters, they did a good job.

The sun can be so damaging, even with sunscreen on, so this allows me to not worry so much about that. The baby is 100% shaded when in this floaty, which is very important to me. We can stay in the pool for as long as we want and not worry about his sensitive skin getting burned. He sits comfortably in the mesh part where his legs go thru, and sometimes even leans backward in it like he's laying in a hammock! haha Personally, we don't use the blow-up octopus part on the front. We tried it at first but soon realized he had trouble seeing around it because he's still so small. So we replaced that. We chose to attach the toys to the sides where the canopy snaps on/off. He really loves the squeaky fish! The only other drawback is that when he's in the floaty, he can't actually reach the water with his hands to splash. He sits in the water but other than that, he can't reach it. So that is a bit of a bummer. But overall, we really love it and would recommended it. It is so cute too!\",\n",

Well, there was a lot to compensate for...before it caught fire.\\n\\nAfter about 5-10 minutes of flying, it came in for a landing, tilted a few inches from the ground, caught the grass and flipped.  Not a hard landing at all, and no physical damage.  On picking it back up, the propellers were spinning at full speed (with the throttle off) and smoke was coming out of the battery compartment.

It begins with a foreword by the author in which she outlines each of the stories, most of which take place on worlds of her well-known Ekumen, her &#147;Hainish Universe.&#148;. However alien the cultures may be, however strange their societal structures and customs, Ms. Le Guin uses each tale to underscore what truly unites us and makes us human. These stories comprise the first two-thirds of the book.\\nAs much as I relish Le Guin&#146;s Hainish stories, it is the novelette &#147;Paradises Lost,&#148; comprising the final third of the book, that is most rewarding. It&#146;s a change of pace for the author, involving not the worlds of the Ekumen, but rather a generation spacecraft on a 201-year voyage from Earth to a &#147;New Earth&#148; orbiting some unnamed neighboring star. Most of the narrative involves characters who have lived their entire lives in this self-contained bubble of metal and air. They know nothing of Earth save what they have experienced via films and &#147;virtual reality&#148; programs. The simple concept of &#147;sky&#148; is completely unfathomable to them. They have their own rituals and customs with which they structure their lives until it becomes necessary to debark on the surface of a new world. Ultimately, for some hese colonists who have become comfortable in their self-contained universe, the notions of OUTSIDE and NEW WORLD begin to seem rather intimidating and even evil. How will they cope when the spacecraft arrives at its destination? Ms. Le Guin deftly explores this culture and its destiny, and the ending quite literally brought tears to my eyes. Throughout &#147;The Birthday of the World,&#148; we realize how much we have in common as human beings, no matter whether we are on Gethen, in a spaceship, on Earth, or anywhere in the universe, that we have our loves, our hopes, and our fears, and that EVERY DAY is the birthday of the world.\",\n",

       " 'There are two things that might be of interest to some viewers. One is that director of \"Solstice\" is Daniel Myrick, who co-directed a hugely successful horror \"The Blair Witch Project\" in 1999 (with Eduardo Snchez). The other is his latest film stars Shawn Ashmore (\"Iceman\" of the \"X-Men\" franchise) and Amanda Seyfried (a young bride-to-be in \"Mamma Mia!\"). As a horror film, however, \"Solstice\" offers little more than familiar scares and ineffective narrative despite its stars, beautifully shot photography and some intriguing narrative elements.\\n\\n\"Solstice\" follows the story of Megan (Elisabeth Harnois) trying to recover from one shocking incident that happened to her family, and her friends Christian, Zoe, Mark and Alicia. They travel to a quiet lake house for their annual summer trip, where Megan starts experiencing strange things, like seeing things. Megan comes to believe that some supernatural presence is trying to contact her, perhaps her twin sister Sophie, to let Megan know some secrets. Or maybe she is mistaken.\\n\\nI can\\'t reveal it in detail, but in the second half of the film an interesting development takes place as Megan realizes the truth about the weird images she continues to see. But the film\\'s slow-paced earlier part is boring with clichd devices such as moving shadows and a \"creepy\" old guy (R. Lee Ermey). In the end of the film everything is explained and some of the characters, including R. Lee Ermey\\'s \"Leonard,\" show unexpected sides, but it takes too long (more than 50 minutes) before the film reaches that point.\\n\\nAccording to the opening credit, \"Solstice\" is based on a 2003 Danish film \"Midsommer.\" Perhaps something is lost in translation. Perhaps not. Whichever it is, I feel there is a better movie buried in here.',\n",

A quality mount is important as the best optic is useless if you match it to junk rings. That said I didn't want to spend as much on the mount as I did on the mount and had read good things about this mount. The rings are uniquely hinged. The mount itself is well machined and very light weight. Aero has gather a good reputation for itself by making good quality items at fair prices and this mount is exactly that.\\n\\nThere are a few things to be aware of. Because of the way the rings are made the scope has a tendency to turn in the rings when they are tightened. You can try to compensate for that. Or you can apply a light coat of oil to the ring/scope allowing them to move. The second is that because the mount is aluminum and the screws are steel you need to be very careful with your torque. The mount comes with a allen wrench and instructions which I recommend you follow carefully and you will have no issues. Do no over tighten as it is easy to strip the aluminum threads. All in all this is a fantastic mount for a very good price and a great optic for an ultra light build.\",\n",

I've been using this for my 90 lb Lab, and while he can be a tad rambunctious on the leash (particularly when the squirrels are out), this leash makes control pretty easy. I think my favorite part is the elastic-type that allows the dog to feel graduated tension before the leash becomes taut. I actually found my dog slowing down of his own accord when the leash started tightening up. Then there's what I think of as the short-hold-handle, that spares me from having to wrap the leash around my hands if I want to shorten the lead for whatever reason. In sum, this is a really good leash. I found the clasp to be a little sticky, but some WD-40 took care of it and it works well. I don't have any qualms about using this leash.\",\n",
